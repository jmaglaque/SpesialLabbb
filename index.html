      <p>First of all po, I want to thank the Lord for helping us get through this whole semester. Thank you, Ma'am Roan, for being our instructor, friend, and second mother in the classroom. My journey here is just beginning, and I truly appreciate all the knowledge you have shared with us and your patience in teaching the lessons in a way that everyone can understand and apply in the future.</p>

      <p>Actually, this subject has been enjoyable, even though there were indeed struggles, just like in any other subject. But as they say, you can't achieve success without going through some hardships. I also want to acknowledge how your support has made a difference in our learning experience. Your passion for the subject really shines through and inspires us to do our best. Thank you so much for your evident effort to help us learn. I am grateful that you have been a part of my college journey, and I will never forget you. Take care always po Ma'am Roan!</p>


      <p>As the semester comes to an end, I hope you take some much-deserved time for yourself to relax and recharge Ma'am. Your well-being matters, and I hope you get to enjoy every moment with your loved ones during the holidays. May this season bring you joy, peace, and fulfillment, and may the New Year ahead be filled with new adventures and opportunities.</p>
